# Data-visualization-for-stocks-price
This project explores and visualizes data related to American bank stocks. It utilizes the pandas library for data manipulation and analysis, and Matplotlib for creating various visualizations.

Data Source:
The data used in this project can be obtained from [source_link] (replace with the actual data source). It is assumed the data contains information about American bank stocks, including historical prices, market capitalization, or other relevant financial metrics.

Libraries Used:
1. pandas: Used for data loading, cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
2. matplotlib: Used for creating various data visualizations such as line plots, bar charts, histograms, and subplots.

Project Structure:
The project directory might contain the following files (adjust based on your actual structure):
1.data.csv (or equivalent): The raw data file containing bank stock information.
2.data_analysis.py: The Python script responsible for loading, cleaning, and analyzing the data.
3.data_visualization.py: The Python script responsible for creating visualizations using Matplotlib.
4.README.md (this file): This file provides a project overview.

Data Visualization Techniques:
The data_visualization.py script will likely implement various visualization techniques, including:
1.Time Series Plots: Visualizing historical stock prices over time using line plots.
2.Distribution Plots: Using histograms or boxplots to explore the distribution of financial metrics like market capitalization.
3.Comparison Plots: Employing bar charts or scatter plots to compare different bank stocks based on specific metrics.
4.Subplots: Combining multiple visualizations within a single figure window using Matplotlib's plt.subplot function.

Expected Output:
The project should generate various plots and visualizations that provide insights into the data. These visualizations can be saved as image files (e.g., PNG, JPG) for further analysis or presentation.

Running the Project:
1.Ensure you have pandas and matplotlib installed (pip install pandas matplotlib).
2.Replace [source_link] with the actual data source URL if the data isn't included locally.
3.Run the scripts:
4.python data_visualization.py (to create the visualizations)

Further Exploration:
This project serves as a starting point for data visualization of  bank stocks. You can further explore by:
1.Adding new visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, pie charts) to compare different aspects of the data.
2.Implementing interactive visualizations using libraries like Bokeh or Plotly.
3.Integrating statistical analysis techniques to draw more robust conclusions from the data.
